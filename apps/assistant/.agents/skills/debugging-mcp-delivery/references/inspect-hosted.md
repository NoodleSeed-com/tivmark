# Inspect hosted state

Read hosted evidence without changing target, credentials, configuration, access, host wiring, revisions, or directory state.

## Use when

- The user asks for hosted status, deployment metadata, health, logs, events, metrics, audit evidence, or diagnosis.
- The request is inspect-only, diagnose-only, or asks whether an existing deployment works.

## Authority boundary

This route is read-only. It never authorizes `login`, `logout`, `link`, `target set`, hosted secret/variable/config/access changes, `deploy`, `rollback`, host configuration writes, or directory submission. If evidence shows one of those actions is needed, report the exact proposed action and target, then stop for a new explicit user request.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the requested org, app, environment, and deployment from existing non-secret context. Do not change the effective target to make inspection easier.
2. Choose the narrowest read-only command: `noodle target show`, `noodle status`, `noodle inspect`, `noodle smoke`, `noodle metrics --agent-output`, `noodle events --json`, `noodle logs`, or `noodle audit`.
3. Prefer machine output when the selected command supports it. Record the target, revision/deployment ID, timestamp, result, and any request ID without exposing secrets or customer payloads.
4. When the installed Developer MCP is available, call `get_context` to read the signed-in user’s current organizations and roles. Resolve the intended organization from the request or project context, then pass that explicit `org` to every scoped inspection or diagnosis tool. Never infer a remote default, and never ask the user to preselect organizations during OAuth. Treat the connection as live evidence gathering, not mutation authority.
5. If a command fails, distinguish missing authentication/access from unhealthy application behavior. Do not repair, relink, redeploy, rotate config, or roll back under this route.

## Stop conditions

- Stop complete when the requested hosted fact is supported by current evidence and higher untested levels are named.
- Stop blocked when existing access cannot read the target or the requested evidence requires a host/user journey unavailable in scope.
- Stop for authorization when the next useful action would mutate local targeting, hosted state, host configuration, or directory state.
