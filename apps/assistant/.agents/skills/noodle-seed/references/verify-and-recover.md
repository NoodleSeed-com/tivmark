# Outcome

Identify the first failing evidence layer, repair only that layer, rerun it, and report the highest level actually proven. A successful lower layer must never be presented as proof of a higher one.

## Use when

- The user asks to validate, test, diagnose, recover, or establish whether a local or hosted Noodle Seed project works.
- A command, connector, App, host integration, deployment, or production check is failing or has uncertain evidence.

## Do not use when

- The primary request is to design or build a new product capability; select its build route and use this playbook only if evidence fails.
- The user asks for a higher-risk external action rather than diagnosis. This route does not grant deployment, publication, live-write, or merge authority.

## Required inputs

Capture the requested evidence level, the exact command or user-visible symptom, sanitized machine output, the environment/target, and the last known passing layer. Do not broaden the goal beyond the level the user asked to prove.

## Workflow

Use this ordered evidence ladder. Start at the last known passing layer or the lowest plausible failure; never jump upward over an unproven dependency:

1. **Compile** — the TypeScript build and authoring import surface are valid.
2. **Validate** — `noodle validate --json` accepts the Noodle contract.
3. **Local smoke** — `noodle test --json` starts the local runtime. Open apps exercise MCP registration; customer-auth apps must instead pass the anonymous 401 plus exact protected-resource metadata boundary and report `interactiveRequired: true`.
4. **Customer auth** — when customer auth is declared, run `noodle auth doctor src/server.ts --json` for metadata and JWKS readiness, then run `noodle devtools src/server.ts`, complete sign-in, and make one authenticated `tools/list` request or representative safe read. The doctor does not prove that registration or token issuance succeeds; the authenticated request proves issuer, signature, stable audience, and exact-resource binding together.
5. **Real API** — a representative safe `noodle tools call` proves connector credentials, transport, observed mapping, and populated data.
6. **App compliance** — `noodle check --json` and local devtools prove the App contract and intended states.
7. **Host** — the requested host connects, invokes the expected capability, and renders useful fallback/UI behavior.
8. **Deploy** — the requested hosted revision and configuration exist and report healthy at the deployment layer.
9. **Production health** — the live production endpoint and requested user journey are observed on the intended revision.

For the first failing layer:

1. Read the process exit code or status first. If machine JSON exists, parse it before reading human prose or editing files.
2. For validation envelopes, inspect every `error.errors[]` item and repair the field at its reported `path`. Use `references/agent-contract.md` for the envelope and `references/compile-errors.md` for the named error code.
3. Form one evidence-backed cause from the observed output. If the two canonical supports do not cover it, select one matching symptom from the router lookup catalog; do not scan every recovery path.
4. Make the smallest in-scope repair. Do not freeform re-edit adjacent code, change credentials, redeploy, or add product behavior without evidence and authority.
5. Rerun only the same evidence layer that failed. Once it passes, continue upward only to the user-requested level.
6. Stop after two evidence-backed repair attempts with the same failure signature, or immediately when the next action requires new authority or external state.

## Verification evidence

Report a compact ledger for every exercised layer: command/action, target, result, and the evidence it establishes. Claim only the highest contiguous passing layer.

- Compile success does not prove runtime behavior.
- Validation and local smoke do not prove a real API mapping or credential path.
- A protected-boundary smoke or passing auth doctor does not prove DCR, token issuance, token audience, or authenticated MCP access.
- Local evidence does not prove hosted or host behavior.
- Deployment existence does not prove production health or a user journey.
- Report every requested but unperformed or blocked higher layer as not run, with the reason.

## Recovery paths

- Compile/validation: repair the exact import, schema, or reported path, then rerun that command without freeform changes.
- Local boot/smoke: use the structured startup error to correct the effective target, config, or entrypoint before retrying.
- Real API: distinguish authentication, reachability, legitimate empty results, and broken response mappings before changing code.
- App: repair the cited contract or state in `noodle check --json`, then confirm it in devtools before attempting a host.
- Host/deployment/production: confirm revision, target, identity, and configuration independently; do not infer one from another.
- Repeated external failure: preserve passing evidence and report the sanitized failure, required authority or external state, owner, and exact next action.

## Stop conditions

- Stop complete when the user-requested evidence level and every dependency below it pass in the current target.
- Stop blocked when progress requires credentials, approval, host access, deployment authority, production access, or an external-state change not available in scope.
- Stop after two evidence-backed repair attempts with the same failure signature at one layer; do not hide repetition behind unrelated edits.
- Never claim fixed or working without rerunning the failed layer, and never upgrade compile, local, deployment, or stale historical evidence into a stronger claim.
