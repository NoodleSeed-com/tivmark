## Design tools for the model

Design tools around what a user says, not 1:1 around API endpoints. A raw wrapper per endpoint (`get_task`, `list_tasks`, `close_task`) forces the model to orchestrate low-level calls and to know identifiers the user never sees — an MCP connector, but not a usable product. Instead:

- **Shape by intent.** Name and scope tools for the job to be done — "find my overdue tasks", "complete the task matching this text" — combining multiple backing calls in one recorded flow (`when(...)`) where it helps.
- **Prefer names/text over raw IDs.** When an action needs an id the user does not know, pair the id-taking operation with a find/search operation that returns model-friendly summaries (id + a human label), so the model resolves text → id itself. Write descriptions that tell the model when to use each tool and how they chain.
- **Return only what the model needs.** Map the response to a small, typed `output` (a few labelled fields), not the raw API payload.

This example pairs a name resolver with an id-taking action: the model calls `find_tasks` to turn the user’s words into an id, then `complete_task`. It is compile-verified on every `pnpm test`.

```ts
import { connector, secret, server, tool, z } from '@noodleseed/one';

const tasks = connector('tasks').version('1.0.0').http({
  baseUrl: 'https://api.tasks.example',
  allowedOrigins: ['https://api.tasks.example'],
  auth: { kind: 'bearer', secret: secret('TASKS_TOKEN') },
  operations: {
    search_tasks: {
      type: 'read',
      method: 'GET',
      path: '/tasks',
      query: ['query'],
      input: z.object({ query: z.string() }),
      output: z.object({ matches: z.array(z.unknown()) }),
      response: { matches: '${response.results}' },
    },
    close_task: {
      type: 'action',
      method: 'POST',
      path: '/tasks/{id}/close',
      input: z.object({ id: z.string() }),
      output: z.object({ ok: z.boolean() }),
      response: { ok: '${response.ok}' },
    },
  },
});

export default server('todo', { title: 'Tasks', version: '1.0.0', use: { tasks } }, [
  tool('find_tasks', {
    description: 'Find tasks whose text matches a query — call this first to resolve a task the user names by text into its id, then pass that id to complete_task.',
    input: z.object({ query: z.string() }),
    output: z.object({ matches: z.array(z.object({ id: z.string(), title: z.string() })) }),
    fulfil: ({ input, connectors }) => {
      const found = connectors.tasks.search_tasks({ query: input.query });
      return { matches: found.matches };
    },
  }),
  tool('complete_task', {
    description: 'Mark a task complete by its id (get the id from find_tasks).',
    input: z.object({ id: z.string() }),
    output: z.object({ ok: z.boolean() }),
    fulfil: ({ input, connectors }) => {
      const result = connectors.tasks.close_task({ id: input.id });
      return { ok: result.ok };
    },
  }),
]);
```

The model never sees a task id from the user; `find_tasks` returns `{ id, title }` summaries it can pick from, then `complete_task` acts by id. Keep write actions (`complete_task`) separate and explicitly described so the host can gate them.

## Title and annotations

Every model-visible tool needs a `title` — the action name hosts show in tool pickers and confirmation prompts — and `annotations`. `annotations.readOnly()` is a closed-world safe read; `annotations.action()` affects the world; `annotations.localAction()` affects only this app's data; `annotations.openAction()` reaches the open internet. Keep reads and writes in separate tools: one tool that both lists and mutates cannot be annotated honestly, so no host can gate it correctly. Missing titles and hints are also the most common consumer-directory rejection.

## Bound every output

Always declare `output`. Without it the model has to parse prose and hosts have no structured result to render. Then bound any list: cap the array with `z.array(item).max(50)`, or take a bounded pagination input (`limit`, `cursor`). An unbounded list either exhausts the context window or is truncated somewhere you do not control. Map the response to the few labelled fields the model needs, never the raw upstream payload — every field you pass through is context paid for on every later turn.

## Keep the tool surface small

`noodle check` warns above 20 model-visible tools. That is a documented heuristic, not a host limit: no host publishes a hard number, and the real threshold depends on how distinct your descriptions are. Collapse variants that differ only by a filter into one intent-shaped tool with a typed enum, and mark widget-only helpers `visibility: ['app']` so they stay callable from the app surface without entering the model's list.

## Provision context deliberately

Most “the model guessed wrong” bugs are missing context, not a missing tool. Every invocation already carries a server-authoritative instant plus locale and time zone, so never ask the model for today's date. Set `server(..., { context: { defaults: { locale, timeZone } } })` for ambient defaults, and mark one zero-input tool `contextProvider: true` when the model needs portable application context such as workspace, plan, or permissions. `references/authoring-workflow.md` owns the full invocation-context contract.

## Errors an agent can act on

An agent cannot recover from “Request failed”. Say which argument was wrong, which tool resolves it, and whether retrying helps. Error text is part of the tool interface and is read far more often by a model than by a human.

## What `noodle check` reports

- `tool_design_titles` — a model-visible tool has no `title`.
- `tool_design_output_shape` — a model-visible tool has no `output` schema.
- `tool_design_output_bounds` — an output array has no `maxItems` and the tool takes no pagination input.
- `tool_design_surface_budget` — more than 20 model-visible tools.
- `tool_design_context` — which tool provides application context (informational).

All five are warnings, never failures, so they never change the exit code. Use `noodle check --min-severity warn` to see only what needs fixing and `noodle check --json` to consume them programmatically.
