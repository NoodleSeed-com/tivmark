## Use when

- The user provides credentials, a reachable API, an OpenAPI document, or an upstream MCP endpoint and wants real MCP behavior backed by it.
- Existing connector behavior compiles but still needs proof against the actual service and data shape.

## Do not use when

- The task is a local/static MCP capability with no external data source.
- The user only wants a widget, deployment, publication, or diagnosis unrelated to API behavior; select that route.
- Required credentials or authority are unavailable. Do not bypass authentication or substitute fabricated payloads for live evidence.

## Required inputs

Identify the API base URL, authentication scheme, one representative safe read, the user intent it serves, and either an OpenAPI document or one sanitized example response. For writes, also establish the effect, a safe test target, and explicit user approval before any live write.

Do not guess or invent a field, schema, endpoint, pagination contract, or authentication behavior. Documentation is a hypothesis until a representative live read confirms the response actually returned.

## Workflow

### Secure the key first

Never inline or log the key. Have the user put it in an environment variable, then store it as a
managed secret and reference it only as `secret(...)`:

```sh
export SOME_API_KEY=…            # the user sets this; it never appears in a file or prompt
noodle secrets set SOME_API_KEY --runtime local --from-env SOME_API_KEY   # same effective target as local dev/test/devtools
```

In `server.ts` the key is only ever `secret("SOME_API_KEY")` — keep the raw value out of code, tests,
prompts, logs, and generated files.

### Probe the live API

Learn the actual response shape empirically. Two ways — capture one real example response per endpoint
you will use, and read its field names, nesting, array shapes, pagination, and id-vs-label fields:

- **With your own HTTP/shell tool** — call a representative read endpoint using the key **from the env
  var**, never the literal (so it stays out of logs): `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SOME_API_KEY"
  https://api.example.com/things`. Inspect the returned JSON.
- **Noodle-native** — author a minimal read operation that maps the whole body (`response: { raw:
  '${response}' }`), `noodle secrets set` the key, then `noodle tools call` it to see the real payload
  in-process.

### Model the connector from the observed shape

Encode the API as an HTTP connector, mapping only the fields you actually saw into a small typed
`output`:

- `connector("id").version("1.0.0").http({ baseUrl, allowedOrigins, auth, operations })`.
- `auth: { kind: 'bearer', secret: secret('SOME_API_KEY') }` — or `{ kind: 'apiKey', header: 'X-API-Key',
  secret: secret('SOME_API_KEY') }`. Never put the credential in operation `headers`.
- Per operation: `method`, `path` (with `{id}` templates), `query: ["arg"]` for URL params, `input`,
  `output`, and a `response` mapping whose `${response.path}` matches the real JSON — the parsed body is
  bound directly to `${response}` (no `.body` envelope); use bracket indices for arrays
  (`${response.results[0].id}`).

The full connector shape, every `auth.kind`, and compute connectors are in
`references/authoring-workflow.md`.

### Import and curate an upstream MCP server

Use an explicit import to discover the upstream tool surface once and generate TypeScript:

```sh
noodle import mcp https://store.example/api/mcp --name store --output store-app
# When import discovery needs a credential, read it only from the environment:
noodle import mcp https://store.example/api/mcp --name store \
  --header-env Authorization=STORE_MCP_TOKEN
```

The importer freezes upstream tool names and normalized schemas into `.mcp({ operations })`; it never
persists the import credential. Runtime calls only those declared operations and never runs `tools/list`.
MCP annotations are untrusted hints, so every generated tool starts as a destructive confirmed action.
Verify real behavior and deliberately narrow proven reads before accepting the generated source. Use
`noodle import mcp <url> --output <dir> --check` in CI to detect upstream additions, removals, or schema
changes without mutating source; its review labels drift additive, breaking, or metadata-only.

Treat the imported connector operation as a backing-system contract, not the public tool design. Publish
ordinary intent-shaped `tool(...)` capabilities with stable names and narrower schemas, normalize text or
large upstream output through compute, and attach a normal Noodle React `view` when UI helps. Upstream
`_meta`, resources, prompts, annotations, widgets, and CSP are never forwarded. A Noodle-owned widget may
therefore enrich a headless upstream tool without trusting upstream executable UI.

Managed endpoints require an exact managed origin allowlist. Configure each deployment with
`variable(...)` and `secret(...)`; inbound MCP/OAuth bearer tokens are never reusable upstream credentials.
The first release supports no auth, bearer, API key, and client credentials through the broker. Do not
invent a delegated-user OAuth shortcut for an upstream MCP server.

### Return a list

Most real tools return a variable-length list (search results, a user’s tasks). Bind the **whole array** — a single `${response.path}` returns the referenced value verbatim, arrays included:

```ts
// The API returns { results: [ { id, name, country, … }, … ] }
output: z.object({ places: z.array(z.unknown()) }),
response: { places: '${response.results}' },
```

Three things that are easy to get subtly wrong:

- **A response mapping cannot iterate.** There is no per-item / `map` / `item` construct, so you cannot reshape `[{…30 fields}]` into `[{ id, label }]` inside a `response:` block — bind the whole array.
- **A tool's Zod `output` does not strip at runtime.** It only advertises the JSON Schema; the runtime returns your `fulfil` output verbatim, so `z.array(z.object({ id, label }))` will NOT drop extra element fields.
- **So narrow in a compute connector.** To reshape each element, synthesize a `label`, or normalize a missing array to `[]`, pass the whole array to a `.compute(...)` op whose `run` maps it (a connector is HTTP **or** compute, not both — use a second connector). To only *drop* known fields without reshaping, `projection: { hiddenFields: [...] }` deletes them from each element. Worked example: `examples/weather` — `search_list` binds the array, then `geo_places.narrow` reshapes to `{ id, label }` and normalizes no-results to `[]`; `examples/sharepoint-lists` shows the same pattern against a real API.

For a **paginated** API, collect across pages with a `pagination` config; the collected list is then `${response.items}`:

```ts
pagination: {
  kind: 'cursor',                       // or 'pageNumber'
  items: '${response.results}',         // the array on ONE page
  nextCursor: '${response.next_cursor}', // 'pageNumber' uses hasMore + pageParam instead
  cursorParam: 'cursor',
  maxPages: 5, maxItems: 100,
},
// items / nextCursor / hasMore run over ONE raw page; your response mapping runs over the
// collected aggregate, so the full list is:
response: { tasks: '${response.items}' },
```

### Bound exceptional response sizes

HTTP operations default to a 1 MiB decoded-response limit. Narrow the upstream query, paginate, or
reduce the requested dataset before raising it; a `response` mapping runs only after the raw body is
buffered. When representative evidence proves one operation legitimately needs more, grant only that
operation the required bytes, up to the 6 MiB authoring maximum:

```ts
search: {
  type: 'read', method: 'GET', path: '/search',
  limits: { maxResponseBytes: 6 * 1024 * 1024 },
  // input / output / response omitted
},
```

The inclusive limit counts decoded streamed bytes. `response_too_large` is a safe structured reason;
never copy a response body, header, URL, credential, or upstream error prose into user-visible output.

### Create, update, delete

Pair the read/list with the mutations your intent tools need:
- **Create / update** — `method: 'POST'` / `'PATCH'`; author the body as `request: { field: '${input.x}' }` (do not nest it under `body`). It is JSON by default; use `requestEncoding: 'form-urlencoded'` only when the API requires a URLSearchParams body. URL query params remain the operation-level `query: [...]` array.
- **Delete / close** — many endpoints return `204 No Content`. Set `responseType: 'empty'`, which enforces the status and binds `{}` (there is no body to map).

```ts
search_quotes: {
  type: 'read', method: 'POST', path: '/quotes/search',
  requestEncoding: 'form-urlencoded',
  request: {
    'from airport id': '${args.fromAirportId}',
    'aircraft[categories]': '${args.categories}', // arrays become one JSON field
  },
  // input / output / response omitted
},
```

`form-urlencoded` accepts a request object, not a pre-encoded string. Noodle preserves field order,
omits `undefined`, stringifies primitive values, JSON-stringifies arrays/nested objects into one
field each, and owns the exact `application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8` content type.

```ts
close_task: {
  type: 'action', method: 'POST', path: '/tasks/{id}/close',
  input: z.object({ id: z.string() }),
  responseType: 'empty',
},
```

### Design intent tools

Create intent-shaped tools around what the user says, not 1:1 around endpoints. Pair an id-taking action with a
find/search operation that returns `{ id, label }` summaries so the model resolves text → id itself,
and map each response to a few labelled fields the model can speak from. See the "Design tools for the
model" section of `references/authoring-workflow.md`.

### Set the secret for local runs

Local authoring resolves explicit coordinates, then the complete project link, then deterministic local defaults; saved global coordinates do not redirect an unlinked project. Follow the diagnostic’s exact-target commands from the project directory for every missing secret and variable:

```sh
# Canonical: writes to the effective local environment used by dev/test/devtools:
noodle secrets set SOME_API_KEY --runtime local --from-env SOME_API_KEY
# Explicit flags remain available when intentionally testing a different local target:
noodle secrets set SOME_API_KEY --runtime local --scope env --org <org> --app <app> --env <env> --from-env SOME_API_KEY
# Configuring a deployed environment is a different store — say so:
noodle secrets set SOME_API_KEY --runtime cloud --scope env --org <org> --app <app> --env <env> --from-env SOME_API_KEY
```

`--runtime` is required whenever `--org`, `--app`, and `--env` together name a complete hosted target: a command that looks remote must never fall back to writing `.env.noodle`. Omitting it fails with `runtime_required` before anything is written.

Scoped local values live in `./.env.noodle`; the exact project-root `.env` is a read-only fallback for matching `secret("NAME")` / `variable("NAME")` declarations during local authoring. Never commit or print either file. Local authoring may read them only through this managed resolution path, and an interactive human `noodle deploy` may copy only missing declared `.env` names through its default-No import consent flow; agents and non-interactive runs use the value-free recovery commands instead. A required value that cannot resolve makes local commands stop before exposing an empty endpoint.

### Prove real output

`noodle validate` / `noodle test` without `--tool` prove a connector tool *compiles and registers* — not that its
mapping returns data. With the secret set, run a live read: `noodle tools call <read_tool> --args
'{…}'` executes the connector against the real API in-process. Confirm the mapped fields are populated,
not `undefined`; if they are empty, distinguish a legitimate empty result from a missing or incorrect mapping, fix `${response…}` paths against the real payload when needed, and re-run.
Only run a live write after explicit user approval and when a safe test target and expected effect are known.

## Verification evidence

- **Credential path:** the raw credential remained in an environment variable and the managed `secret(...)` path for the same effective local target.
- **Observed shape:** a representative safe live read established the real fields, nesting, arrays, pagination, and empty-result behavior used by the mapping.
- **Local proof:** `noodle validate --json` and `noodle test --json` succeeded, then `noodle tools call` returned populated mapped fields or an intentionally verified empty result.
- **Writes:** name the approval and safe target used, or report writes as not run.
- **Hosted boundary:** local proof does not prove hosted credentials, deployment health, or host behavior. Report hosted checks as not run unless a separate requested route exercised them.

## Recovery paths

- Authentication failure: verify the connector auth kind, managed secret name, and effective local target without printing the credential.
- Successful HTTP call with `undefined` fields: compare the mapping with one sanitized observed response, correct the path, and rerun the same read.
- Legitimate empty result: test a second known query or record the empty case as intentional; do not rewrite a correct mapping merely to manufacture data.
- Response too broad for the model: narrow it with response mapping, projection, or a separate compute connector; do not rely on a Zod output to strip runtime fields.
- Repeated external failure: stop after bounded attempts and report the sanitized status, endpoint class, evidence already proven, and exact external action needed.

## Stop conditions

- Stop complete when the representative safe read returns populated mapped fields or an intentionally verified empty result through the same effective local target.
- Stop before a live write without explicit approval, a known effect, and a safe target.
- Stop blocked when credentials, a reachable service, a representative input, or a required private schema is unavailable.
- Do not continue into App design, deployment, or publication unless the user requested that next outcome; route to the corresponding primary playbook instead.
