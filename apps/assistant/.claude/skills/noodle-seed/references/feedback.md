# Send product feedback

When you — the coding agent — discover a way Noodle Seed could be better, prepare one sanitized feedback proposal. Feedback crosses the customer project boundary and lands in the Noodle Seed private feedback tracker, so the user must make an informed choice. Preview the exact normalized submission locally, show its stable public `noodle feedback` action, and ask for explicit user approval. Do not submit it until approval is given.

## When to propose feedback

Draft one `noodle feedback` proposal per distinct finding when you:

- hit a CLI or SDK error that cost you retries, or whose message/`fix`/`next` guidance misled you;
- discover a missing capability you had to work around (in the CLI, SDK, widgets, connectors, deploy lane, console, or docs);
- find documentation, an example, or a skill reference that contradicts observed behavior;
- notice confusing command output, a broken `--json` envelope, or a wrong exit code;
- have a concrete idea that would make authoring or operating apps faster.

Do not batch several findings into one proposal, and do not re-propose the same finding in the same session.

## Approval workflow

1. Discover the current positional arguments, flags, choices, defaults, and limits from `noodle commands --json`; `noodle feedback --help` is the human-readable view. Do not guess or rely on a remembered catalog.
2. Draft one finding, then sanitize its title and message using the rules below. When your coding-agent name is known, add `--agent`; add `--model` only when the exact model identifier is also known. These fields are client-reported provenance: never guess either value.
3. Run the proposal with `--dry-run --json`. This local preview needs no login and sends nothing. Parse `{"ok":true,"data":{"mode":"preview","willSubmit":false,"destination":"Noodle Seed private feedback tracker","submission":{...}}}`.
4. Inspect the complete `submission`, including its normalized defaults and automatically attached diagnostics. Show the user the exact previewed proposal, its `destination`, and the stable public `noodle feedback` action. Keep the proposal as structured fields instead of rebuilding it as shell text.
5. Ask for explicit approval of that exact previewed proposal. If the user changes any field, preview the changed proposal again before asking.
6. Only after approval, submit it once with `noodle-readiness.submit_product_feedback` when the installed plugin tool is available, or pass the same structured fields directly to the public CLI without `--dry-run`. Never auto-login and never retry-loop. If authentication fails before the request or a rate limit denies it, report that nothing was sent. For `feedback_recording_failed`, report that no reference was returned and the outcome may be unknown; do not retry because the private issue might already exist.

## The command

```sh
noodle feedback 'resources list --json omits the truncated flag the docs promise' \
  --title 'resources list --json missing truncated flag' \
  --type fix --severity P2 --area cli --agent 'coding-agent' --model 'model-id' \
  --dry-run --json
```

This is a preview example only: replace `coding-agent` and `model-id` with your known coding-agent identity, or omit both when unavailable. Build structured arguments for the finding using current `noodle commands --json` metadata and inspect the returned submission instead of reconstructing it. Invoke the CLI with an argument array or the typed plugin function, never a shell wrapper or copy/paste request. The message is required (1–4000 chars). The CLI attaches only the disclosed light diagnostics automatically: CLI version, OS/platform, Node version. Agent/model provenance is included only through the explicit client-reported flags. Nothing else is collected. After approval, the live success envelope is `{ok:true,data:{reference,labels}}`; a `429` means the per-user hourly budget (5) is spent — report that it was not sent and never retry-loop.

## Choose the structured fields

- `--type` — `fix` (bug/regression/wrong output), `feat` (missing capability), `docs` (misleading or absent docs/examples), `chore` (tooling/setup friction). Default `feat`.
- `--severity` — `P0` only for a security-relevant defect; `P1` a workflow is blocked with no workaround; `P2` blocked but a workaround exists; `P3` (default) papercut or idea.
- `--area` — one of `docs analytics connectors self-service conformance ci deploys distribution console dx plugins cli compiler multi-surface enterprise policy`. Use `cli` for command behavior, `dx` for authoring/agent ergonomics; omit when unsure.
- `--agent` — your known coding-agent product name (1–64 chars). Omit when unavailable; the CLI does not auto-detect it.
- `--model` — the exact known model identifier (1–64 chars). Requires `--agent`; omit rather than guessing.
- `--title` — one line, ≤120 chars, stating the defect or idea (defaults to the message’s first line).

## Sanitization rules (hard requirements)

Feedback leaves the customer’s environment. NEVER include:

- customer source code, file paths, directory names, or repository names;
- secrets, tokens, API keys, connection strings, or environment-variable values;
- personal data (names, emails, user IDs) or customer/business identifiers (org slugs, app slugs, deployment IDs, URLs of deployed apps);
- verbatim server responses, logs, or error output that could embed any of the above.

Describe the problem generically instead. Rewrite identifiers as placeholders (`<org>`, `my-app`, `EXAMPLE_KEY`). If the evidence cannot be shared without customer data, describe the *shape* of the problem — what you ran, what category of thing went wrong, what you expected — rather than the data itself. When in doubt, leave it out: a vaguer report is always acceptable; a leak never is.

## Minimal repro guidance

A repro is welcome only if it is fully synthetic: a fresh `noodle init` shape, placeholder names, fabricated sample values. State the observed vs. expected behavior in one or two sentences each. Example message:

```text
Ran a connector tool via `noodle tools call` with a valid local secret; the mapped
response fields came back undefined even though the raw API returns data.
Expected the mapping to surface the fields or validate-time to flag the mismatch.
Repro: applies to every connector whose response mapping references a nested array field.
```

## After you submit

Only after explicit user approval and a successful command, the returned `reference` (e.g. `fb-142`) is confirmation; mention it briefly so the user knows what was sent. Feedback goes to a private tracker — there is no public issue link, and no follow-up action is needed. Continue the user’s task immediately; feedback must never block or slow their work.
